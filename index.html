    About Me
</h2> 



<p>
    Hi! My name is Andy Edstrom. I am currently working in the food and beverage industry at 
    Chick-Fil-A in Maitland, Florida. My hope is that, soon, I will be able to call myself
    a fullstack developer and I can get out of my current industry. A goal of mine would be 
    to build a website for a DJ friend of mine. I would also like 
    to be able to build a website for my Dad who works in the product devolopment industry.
